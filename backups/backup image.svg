       On another site, DC382X had stopped 2 wars and 5 heated arguments in a 3 day span.<h5></h5> He was starting to get very annoyed with this.  <h3>-------------------------------------------</h3>The project started out as a JS-only project, under the name ASBFSF (Anti-Spam Bot For <h5></h5>[Redacted] Forums), and only had set messages. <h3>-------------------------------------------</h3>Later, HTML was slowly introduced- still with set messages. He renamed the full project name <h5></h5>to Anti-Spam Bot For Spammed Forums.<h3>-------------------------------------------</h3>DC382X then got his github. He made a site- no more set crap, and renamed to Anti-Spam <h5></h5>Bookmarklet Formatter.<h3>-------------------------------------------</h3> But this repo was clogged and confusing. He moved to ASXF (Anti-Spam Extract Form) due <h5></h5> to it being an extracted version of ASBF.
