     <a><h1>ASXF</h1>
     AXSF is a project made by DC382X, as an anti-spam/quick reply.
     <h2>Combat Spam!</h2>
     This can be used to quickly respond to spam.
     <h2>Use for quick replying!</h2>
     This allows you to make quick relpies, without having to write it out!
       <h2>Reason for existence</h2>
     On another site, DC382X had stopped 2 wars and 5 heated arguments in a 3 day span. He was starting to get very annoyed with this. 
       <br>The project started out as a JS-only project, under the name ASBFSF (Anti-Spam Bot For <br>[Redacted] Forums), and only had set messages. 
         <br><br>Later, HTML was slowly introduced- still with set messages. He renamed the full project name <br>to "Anti-Spam Bot For Spammed Forums."
       <br><br>DC382X then got his github. He made a site- no more set crap, and renamed to "Anti-Spam <br>Bookmarklet Formatter"
       <br><br> But this repo was clogged and confusing. He moved to ASXF (Anti-Spam Extract Form) due <br> to it being an extracted version of ASXF.
